### Unit Testing
For every new file and method, add test(s) to the corresponding file or make a new test file in energy-analytics-comps/test
that must be named test_<FILE_BEING_TESTED>.  Try to keep tests simple/each test only tests one thing.  Try to keep tests
realistic--have test cases covering what the functionality you have built will be relied upon doing.  The idea is that
if someone makes a change that would break some process or some core part of what your code was doing, a test should break
so that the person making the change knows that it is either breaking or changing functionality.

#### To run unit testing
```unix
coverage run --source=test -m nose2
```
